Business Analytics Master's Student | Data Enthusiast | Finance Passionate

I am driven by a passion for learning and a deep curiosity about data. I believe numbers offer the clearest path to understanding reality, which is why I advocate for learning through data-driven insights. Originally from Colombia, I now live in New York, where I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Business Analytics. My focus lies in leveraging analytics to solve complex problems, particularly within the finance industry. I am excited to continue learning and growing in this field, and I am always looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge.
